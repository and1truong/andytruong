## Ownership

- At any given time, you can have either one mutable reference or any number of immutable references.
- References must always be valid.

### Mut reference


```rust
// Error: Users of an immutable reference donâ€™t expect the values to suddenly change out from under them!
{
    let mut s = String::from("hello");
    let r1 = &s; // no problem
    let r2 = &s; // no problem
    let r3 = &mut s; // BIG PROBLEM

    println!("{}, {}, and {}", r1, r2, r3);
}

// OK
{
    let mut s = String::from("hello");

    let r1 = &s; // no problem
    let r2 = &s; // no problem
    println!("{} and {}", r1, r2);
    // r1 and r2 are no longer used after this point

    let r3 = &mut s; // no problem
    println!("{}", r3);
}
```

### No dangling

```rust
fn main() {
    let reference_to_nothing = dangle();
}

// Error: s goes out of scope, and is dropped. Its memory goes away. Danger!
fn dangle() -> &String {
    let s = String::from("hello");

    &s
}

// OK
fn no_dangle() -> String {
    let s = String::from("hello");

    s
}
```
